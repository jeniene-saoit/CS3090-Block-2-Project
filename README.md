# CS3090-Block-2-Project

This Java Program checks the strength of a password entered by the user. The password strength is determined from the password's character types, character position, and password length. 
Upon execution, the program provides two outputs: a rating of the user's password ("Weak," "Medium," "Slightly Good," or "Strong"), and statistics based on the password strength criteria.

## How To Run The Program:

**_Before running the program:_** ensure you hava Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.

**_The program can be ran in two way:_**
 **IDE** 
    1. Open an IDE that you can use to run a Java Program.
    2. Download the PasswordStrengthChecker.java file from the repository.
    3. Open the PasswordStrengthChecker.java file in your IDE.
    4. Press the run button.
 **Terminal**
    1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
    2. Download the PasswordStrengthChecker.java file from the repository.
    3. Navigate to the directory where the PasswordStrengthChecker.java file is saved.
    4. Compile the code, following this command:
       
        ```bash
        javac PasswordStrengthChecker.java
        ```
        
    6) Execute the compilation, and run the program with this command:
       
        ```bash
        java PasswordStrengthChecker
        ```
        
  **Upon running the code, the program will prompt the user to enter a password for a password strength evaluation.**

## Warnings and Limitation:

This program is for educational and recreational use only. **DO NOT use this program for securing sensitive information.**

The PasswordStrengthChecker program is a simplified program to give a base test for the strength of one's password. However, this does not fully replicate or represent the same complexity of the techniques used in real-world password strength testers. One should not fully rely on the PasswordStrengthChecker program to determine the strength of their password.

## Ethical Considerations and Responsible Use:

I acknowledge that publicly providing this code may lead to others modifying the code for malicious and unethical purposes.

This program has its limitations and may be misuesed:
  * The program is a simplified form of a password checker. This may lead to a false sense of security for the user, as it does not fully crack down on all the characteristics that make a
  password a "good" or "bad" password.
  * It is possible that someone advertises this password checker program, but modifies the code to obtain and record passwords from users when they use the program.

**This program should be used responsibly and ethically.** Be cautious and careful with the information that you put into the program. This program should not be modified and used with the intent of performing malicious and unethical activity.
